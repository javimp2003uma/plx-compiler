# plx-compiler
This repository contains a compiler for the PLX language, an extension of the PL language, built using JFlex and CUP. The PLX language, similar to C, requires prior declaration of variables. This project includes lexical and syntax analysis, and generates the same intermediate code as the original PL language.
